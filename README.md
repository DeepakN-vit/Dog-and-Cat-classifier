# Dog-and-Cat-classifier
Developed a Dogs vs Cats Classification system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to accurately distinguish between images of dogs and cats. The project workflow involved several key steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset containing images of dogs and cats was preprocessed using the ImageDataGenerator from TensorFlow. Preprocessing steps included rescaling, shearing, zooming, and horizontal flipping to augment the dataset and improve model generalization.

2. **Model Architecture**: A CNN architecture was designed and implemented using TensorFlow's Keras API. The model consisted of convolutional layers followed by max-pooling layers for feature extraction, with dropout layers introduced for regularization to prevent overfitting. The final layers included fully connected dense layers to classify the images.

3. **Training**: The model was trained using the training set generated by the ImageDataGenerator. The Adam optimizer was employed along with binary cross-entropy loss for binary classification (dogs vs. cats). Training was conducted over multiple epochs to optimize model parameters and achieve high accuracy.

4. **Evaluation**: After training, the model was evaluated using the test set to assess its performance on unseen data. Metrics such as accuracy were used to evaluate the model's ability to correctly classify images.

5. **Prediction**: Using the trained model, predictions were made on new images to classify them as either dogs or cats. The model's output provided probabilities for each class, allowing for confident decision-making.

Overall, the project demonstrated proficiency in deep learning concepts, including CNN architectures, data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction. By accurately classifying images of dogs and cats, the project showcased the potential of CNNs in real-world image classification tasks.
